One thing I liked in Emacs is the ability to insert comments
at the end of line using <M-;>. 
This script tries to achieve the same for Vim.
If there's already a comment, it's aligned.

Maybe, your language is supported. 
If not, it's easy to add new ones.

This script was inspired by Meikel Brandmeyers EnhCommentify.vim: vimscript#23
